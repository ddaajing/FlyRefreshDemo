# FlyRefresh
A simple iOS implementation of [Replace](https://dribbble.com/shots/2067564-Replace), designed by [Zee Youn](https://dribbble.com/zeeyoung).

Inspired by [FlyRefresh by race604](https://github.com/race604/FlyRefresh).

It's just a rough implementation, just for fun.
There are many functions need to be implemented.
